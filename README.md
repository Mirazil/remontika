# Remontika

Remontika is my personal graduation project, implemented using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase (Functions, Storage, Authentication) with Telegram API integration. The project is deployed on Vercel.

This repository hosts a modern landing page that presents complete information about the service and explains its workflow. The primary focus of the project is the fully functional user dashboard: registered users can create repair requests, configure their profile settings, and choose how they wish to receive notifications. Whenever the status of a repair request changes, the new status is reflected in real time on the website. At the same time, users receive an automatic notification via a Telegram bot informing them of the update.

All source code, configuration files, and deployment scripts can be found here. Feel free to explore the implementation details of Next.js pages, Tailwind CSS styling, Firebase Functions for backend logic, and Telegram API integration for messaging. You can view the live application at https://remontika.vercel.app/
